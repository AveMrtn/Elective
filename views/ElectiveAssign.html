<h1><b><center> SEO and SEM </center></b></h1>
<hr />

<h1><center> What is the difference between SEO and SEM? </center></h1>

<p><center> SEO is essentially a component of the larger category, SEM. According to Google’s Knowledge Graph, search engine optimization is “the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.”

The SEO industry is continually changing due to the frequent changes made to Google’s algorithm. But, there is one aspect of SEO that stays constant: SEO is made up of On-Page and Off-Page activities. </center></p>

<h2><center> What components does SEO include? </center></h2>

<h3><center> As stated above, SEO is comprised of two different activities.</center> </h3>






<h1><center> What is search engine marketing (SEM)? </center></h1>

<p><center> According to Wikipedia, “Search engine marketing is a form of Internet marketing that involved the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPS) through optimization and advertising.” SEM includes SEO tactics, as well as several other search marketing tactics. </center></p>

<h1><center> What is the main difference of SEO and SEM? </center></h1>

<p><center> The main difference between these two terms is that search engine optimization is simply a component of search engine marketing. As mentioned above, SEM includes components of paid search, such as PPC and also SMM (social media marketing).

It is important to note that you should never use the terms SEO and SEM interchangeably, because although they work hand in hand, they are not the same term.</center></p>

<h2><center> Domain Name Strategy </center></h2>

<p><center> Domain names are the unique, human-readable Internet addresses of websites. They are made up of three parts: a top-level domain (sometimes called an extension or domain suffix), a domain name (or IP address), and an optional subdomain. </center></p>

<p><img src="domain-description-image.png" align="center" width="850" height="300"></p>

<p><center> The combination of only the domain name and top-level domain is known as a "root domain." The "http://" is part of a page's URL but not its domain name and is known as the "protocol." </center></p>

<h2> Domain name </h2>

<p> Domain names are the second level of a domain's hierarchy (after the top-level domain). Domain names on a specific TLD (called a root domain, discussed below) are purchased from registrars and represent the specific, unique location of a website. In the following examples, the domain names are bolded: </p>

<ul>
<li>www.example.org </li>
<li>https://moz.com </li>
<li>www.blogspot.com </li>
</ul>

<p><center> Search engines do use the keywords in domain names as a ranking factor (which explains the existence of domains like "where-to-buy-the-best-donuts-in-Seattle.com"), but tread lightly when thinking about optimizing your root domain for search engines: One of the specific functions of Google's algorithm is to combat these keyword-stuffed exact-match domains. </center></p>

<h2>Search Engine Indexing Strategy</h2>

<p> Search engine indexing is the process of a search engine collecting, parses and stores data for use by the search engine. The actual search engine index is the place where all the data the search engine has collected is stored. It is the search engine index that provides the results for search queries, and pages that are stored within the search engine index that appear on the search engine results page. Without a search engine index, the search engine would take considerable amounts of time and effort each time a search query was initiated, as the search engine would have to search not only every web page or piece of data that has to do with the particular keyword used in the search query, but every other piece of information it has access to, to ensure that it is not missing something that has something to do with the particular keyword. Search engine spiders, also called search engine crawlers, are how the search engine index gets its information, as well as keeping it up to date and free of spam. </p>
